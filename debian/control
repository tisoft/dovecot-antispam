Description: a Dovecot plugin that helps train spam filters
 dovecot-antispam provides a plugin for the Dovecot IMAP server that
 helps train spam filters. It watches designated spam folders and
 trains mail as spam or non-spam when it moves in or out of those
 folders respectively.  This avoids the problem of needing additional
 folders to track correctly and incorrectly classified spam and non-spam.
 .
 dovecot-antispam supports dspam, crm114, and generic training by
 mailing spam and non-spam to training addresses.  For crm114, it
 supports folders for the additional "unsure" classification, and
 trains when moving from there to spam or normal folders.
 .
 Note that dovecot-antispam needs the type of spam filter configured at
 compile time.  It supports building with a custom name, specifically
 to allow installing multiple variations simultaneously.  This package
 is built to use the mailtrain backend.
