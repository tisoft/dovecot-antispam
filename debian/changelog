dovecot-antispam (1.2+20090702-1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Local build (pseudo-NMU).
  * Depend on the same upstream version of Dovecot we were compiled against,
    since otherwise, the plugin will either not load or not work
    (Closes: #544588; related to #456021 in dovecot).
  * This package will now need a binary NMU for each new upstream version of
    Dovecot. However, it already did, in reality - the new dependency just
    makes this known to the packaging system.
  * Build-Depend on Dovecot between 1.0 and 1.2, since this plugin doesn't
    support earlier or later versions.

dovecot-antispam (1.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.  (Pulling in new upstream source)
  * Rebuild to suit dovecot 1.1.16 currently in unstable.
  * Note in the description this package is built using the mailtrain backend.
    half- Closes: #532605, it probably still would be nice to build for all of
    the backends, but I only need this one too, so add others as people to test
    them put their hands up.
  * Tidy up a little in debian/rules.
